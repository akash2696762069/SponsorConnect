Hello, my name is Akash Gupta, and I am building a Telegram bot-based WebApp for a sponsorship agency. This platform will help small and medium creators connect with sponsorship opportunities. I’ve already set up the bot, and I have the bot token and admin ID. Now, I’m ready to develop the frontend and backend UI and logic.

🎯 Purpose:
To build a Telegram WebApp where:

Creators can apply for sponsorships.

Admin can manage sponsorships and creators.

Everything is authenticated via Telegram login (no external login needed).

📂 WebApp Sections
1️⃣ Profile Section
This section displays the user’s:

Profile photo

Telegram username

Telegram handle

Email

🔧 Features:

User can view and update their email or other editable profile fields.

Changes are saved to a profile.json file.

2️⃣ Dashboard Section
This is the main landing screen of the WebApp after Telegram login.

📌 Layout:

Welcome message with the user’s name.

A button at the top: "Link your platform" → redirects to Link Platform section.

Below that, some featured sponsorships will be displayed as cards.

At the bottom: “Explore More” button → redirects to View Sponsorship section.

3️⃣ View Sponsorship Section
This section displays all active sponsorships.

📦 Each sponsorship appears in a rectangular card:

Shows a banner image.

Title of the sponsorship.

🖱️ On click:

Shows full sponsorship details.

Displays an "Apply Now" button.

📝 On Apply:
User will be asked:

Choose platform: (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram)

Follower count

Platform username

📂 All submitted data will be saved in apply.json.

🔁 Admin will review the applications and either:

4️⃣ Link Platform Section
This section allows users to link their social platforms.

🔘 The user sees 3 buttons:

YouTube

Each with a [+] icon next to them.

➕ On clicking [+] for a platform:
User is asked:

Follower count

🧾 Then, a unique verification code is generated and shown.

📌 The user must add this verification code to their bio/description on that platform.

🕒 After that, they wait for admin approval.

🗂 All submitted data is stored in platform_link.json.

✅ Once the admin verifies the code:

The platform shows a green tick ✅ and the username

User can repeat this process for all platforms
